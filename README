WebBeans is basically a UI layer using jQuery.

It makes heavy use of CSS3 and is currently only tested in Chrome on OSX.

The idea here is to make something that is very lightweight - at first primarily for making admin systems , taking away the hazzle of making the complex ui's dmin systems often require.

Its inspired by Java Swing, ExtJS,jQuery and on the visual side - brutally stolen from Netbeans as you might have guessed :)
