WebBeans is basically a UI layer using jQuery.

It makes heavy use of CSS3 and is currently only tested in Chrome on OSX and is NOT expected to run in anything else than Chrome anytime soon.

The idea here is to make something that is very lightweight - at first primarily for making admin systems , taking away the hazzle of making the complex UI's admin systems often require.

It's inspired by Java Swing, ExtJS,jQuery and on the visual side - brutally stolen from Netbeans as you might have guessed :)

Any and all forks are welcome and appreciated - i'm building this because I want it... now... :)

Update:
Just added a desktop wrapper app that allows you to add native menus to the application. It uses QtWebkit to render the 
application itself.


Build using Qt Creator
